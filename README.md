# AcessNO_B31328_DATA_ANALYSIS_AND_VISUALISATION_Exam
An interactive and live dashboard that tells a compelling, evidence-based data story around a pressing socioeconomic issue in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Questions answered are 1, 2, 5, 6
Simulation and real data were strategically used since no single district-level, open-source, clean dataset exists for all my Questions answered in relation to Sub-Saharan Africa that spans all countries consistently. The datasets used were simulated using the structure and statistical distributions observed from real data sources.
They (datasets) were custom generated to fit purpose by reverse engineering but you can replace the synthetic .CSV files with actual ones, it will still run. The focus here was on testing models (Prophet, VAR), confidence estimation and dashboard implementation to meet the Questions asked or to solve a given task, so realism was preserved. 
These datasets are grounded in real data, enriched and simulated at the subnational level for performance, storytelling and policy experimentation , a widely accepted practice in public data prototyping when disaggregated data is protected or inaccessible.
